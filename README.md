# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

# Purpose of our project

The purpose of this analysis was to determine the number of retiring employees per title, and identify employees who are eligible to participate in a mentorship program. We used pgAdmin/SQL to create and join different csv files in order to get a clearer picture of the "silver tsunami". We also used these tables and the data to find out which employees would be eligible for a mentorship program, so that there is a replacement plan in place..

# The Results

- With the retirment_titles table we are able to see every eligible for retirement employee and how long they have worked at each position over the course of their career.

- The unique titles table that we created is showing the most recent title for employees of retirment age.

- Our retiring_titles shows us the a majority of the employees of retirment age (57,668/90,398 = 64%) have senior titles.

- The final part of our project shows mentorship eligibility, if you look at the head of the new csv - you can see that most of these employees have senior titles.

# Conclusion

In conclusion there are 72,458 roles that will need to be fulfilled once the "silver tsunami" begins and ends. There is not enough eligible employees in the mentorship program for a 1 on 1 mentorship, however, there are most likely some retiring employees that don't meet the eligibility requirments that would be willing to mentor younger employees for their role. There are 5,860 employees eligible for retirement in the Sales department. The total amount of salaries from all the retiring employees is $15,892,491,033. That is a lot of money.
